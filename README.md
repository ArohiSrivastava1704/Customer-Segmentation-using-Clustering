# Customer-Segmentation-using-Clustering

Overview
This project focuses on clustering analysis, an unsupervised machine learning technique used to group similar data points based on their features. The primary objective is to uncover patterns, relationships, or segmentations within the dataset that can drive meaningful insights.

Project Objectives
Identify natural groupings within the dataset.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data structure.
Apply clustering algorithms like K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, or DBSCAN.
Evaluate the quality of the clusters using appropriate metrics (e.g., silhouette score, inertia).
Visualize clusters for better interpretability and actionable insights.
